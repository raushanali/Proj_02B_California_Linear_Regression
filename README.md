# Proj_02B_California_Linear_Regression

This project is based on the California Housing Dataset. It uses a Linear Regression model to predict the average house price (MedHouseVal) in various districts of California. The dataset includes 8 features (such as Median Income, House Age, Average Rooms, Population, etc.).

Purpose
Goal: To predict house prices in California based on social and geographical factors.

Main Features:
Load and process the California Housing dataset
Visualize prices based on Latitude and Longitude (Scatter Plot)
Split the data into training and testing sets
Train a Linear Regression model and evaluate its performance (MSE, R2 score)
Visualize the comparison between actual and predicted prices (Actual vs Predicted scatter plot)

How to Use: 
Run the code in Python (make sure scikit-learn and matplotlib are installed).
When you run the code, you will get the MSE and R2 scores for training and testing, along with two graphs:
One graph showing house prices based on Latitude and Longitude.
Another graph comparing actual and predicted prices.
